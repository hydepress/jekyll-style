title: Welcome to the Jekyll Style Guide
---


### Why write this?

Jekyll's incredibly flexible, but in some instances, the lack of common conventions make things harder for users.

For one, there are many common design patterns that are still relatively unknown to new users (e.g., using `permalink: /about/` in `about.md`, rather than creating `/about/index.md`).

For another, when writing a plugin or theme intended to be used across sites, should it look for `site.title` or `site.name`? `site.description` or `site.tagline`? Moar options, moar problems.

This style guide aims to make it easier to create awesome Jekyll sites by codifying and surfacing Jekyll best practices.



### Want to contribute?


This style guide is intended to be a collaborative resource for the Jekyll community. Please help improve it.

If you'd like to propose a change to the style guide, please suggest the added or modified rule as [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) so that the community can discuss the merits of the proposed change a bit more tangibly.

### A note on the style guide's style

When it comes to software, there are a lot of personal preferences, and Jekyll is no exception. Whenever possible, please try to explain each rule's logical justification and the rule the value provides to end users.
