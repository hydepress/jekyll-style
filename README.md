# Jekyll Style Guide (Reformatted Book Edition)

by Ben Balter et al 

An opinionated guide to common Jekyll design patterns and anti-patterns.


> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the [(official) style guide](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-style-guide/tree/gh-pages/_docs)
for the Jekyll static site builder / generator
reformatted in a single-page book edition.
